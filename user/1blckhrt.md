'''Howdy Feller!'''

My name is {{user|1blckhrt}}, and I'm a moderator on RetroMC. I've played here for a year and continue to enjoy my time here.

This is my user page, and you'll be able to find most information about me here.

My J-Stats page: [https://statistics.retromc.org/player/1blckhrt Click Here]

Below you will find some information about me and some of my various places of residence.

=== Residence 1: The Door in the Hill ===
After joining RetroMC for the first time on December 2, 2022, I read the rules at spawn, then decided to start my adventure using <code>/wild</code>. I didn't like any of the areas I was teleported to, so I kept exploring until I got to this area, which I then built a "hidey-hole" as night fell. After chopping some trees and crafting some basic tools (which are still in the chests there), I ventured into the depths of the underground, where I then started a branch mine to find those blue precious rocks - diamonds.

I later found a zombie spawner that I turned into a mob grinder, but I never really used it because I had other things I wanted to do on the server.

The only other thing to note is the mining area. This was simply just a way for me to get cobblestone for projects. This is where my mining addiction was born and raised.

=== Residence 2: Small Village ===
After scavenging for materials at my first residence, I decided it was time to build a home. I found a design I liked on a website, and I started building. It's similar to a medieval forge, and has multiple floors, the bottom being the work area, the middle being a lounge area, and the top being my bedroom. This home took me approximately 2-3 hours to build because I was referencing the design on the website, and copying it over floor by floor.

I then expanded the village to create a larger storage room, and a town hall (left unfinished, the design's also from a website). The storage area originally held all of my items, but I've probably used a good majority of those items, and what's left isn't useful to me anymore. The town hall was just tedious to build because of the way the design website worked.

Two mob farms were later built near the village, but they didn't work as good as I thought I would, probably due to the lack of spawnproofing and unlit caves below the area. The first one was never finished either.

You'll see that I have a bad habit of starting projects I never finish...

=== Residence 3: Medieval Village ===
I was starting to get sick of the area I was building in previously, it was very flat and I had a hard time trying to make everything look realistic in context to the terrain. It also didn't help that I started projects I never finished. Onto a new area, I guess.

I started by flattening an area and building a flat area over water to make the area easier to build in. I then started on the walls containing the village.

I found the designs for most of the buildings and walls in a YouTube playlist which I will not name for obvious reasons. It took quite a bit of materials as the walls were about 70% made out of logs and wood planks. I ended up setting a home after using <code>/wild</code> so I could gather materials without deforesting the area I settled in.

The village contains several structures, being some houses and an unfinished castle housing a good majority of my storage.

=== Residence 4: Storage Area (In Progress) ===
I needed a better way to store my items instead of keeping them all over the place in random chests, so I dug a hole and I plan to turn it into a storage area. The hole goes down to y=11-12 and will eventually house all of my items so that I don't have to dig through chest after chest in random locations.

=== Residence 5: Atacama Shack ===
I was invited at some point to the village of Atacama, owned by CruxyMC (and previously RevokGaming). I decided I should probably build a small home there to show that I was interested in the town. There's barely anything inside other than a chest and a loft area, but it's not big enough to really do much inside.
