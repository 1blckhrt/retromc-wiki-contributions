The '''Atacama Bridge''' is a massive mega-project started by {{user-nonwiki|aq2a}} that spans from the village of [[Atacama]] to New Edago. The bridge is currently under construction and will eventually connect to the UIP and Spawn Town, originally a pipe dream, but now becoming a reality. The current bridge stretches an astonishing '''4,000 blocks'''.

Instructions on how to build the pillars of the bridge can be viewed in the Discord, and are also listed here, as stated by {{user-nonwiki|aq2a}}.

<br />

=== Instructions ===

For those who are interested in helping who have '''NOT''' worked on the bridge before, ask around to see if someone will teleport you to the current build site!<br />

You will be in charge of building our main pillars. Instructions for how to build them can be found in these images.<br />

In short, these pillars have dimensions of '''7x7''' and will be raised to y=97 ''(this means that when you stand on the top of the pillar, your y value should read y-97)'' Each of these pillars is placed 23 blocks apart from each other ''(count 23 blocks in between each pillar).''<br />

If you are ever unsure of how to build these new pillars feel free to go back and count the blocks or ask me, or other workers for help! '''PLEASE TAKE YOUR TIME AND BUILD THEM CORRECTLY.'''<br />

Below are images posted by {{user-nonwiki|aq2a}} in the Discord on how to help build the bridge.<br />

When you reach the y=97 height, you can return to the ground and begin the construction on the next pillar. ''(bringing a water bucket to get down may be helpful)''<br />

Most of the pillars locations have been marked out already, so you should have an easy way to tell where the next pillar should go.<br />

'''ALL PILLARS MUST BE BUILT OUT OF COBBLESTONE'''. If you are in need of cobble, ask around and see if anyone has any to donate, if not, ask if you can be teleported to the '''UIP''' dig site, that way we can help flatten the '''UIP''' and get the cobble we need for the bridge!!<br />

<br />

=== Rules to keep in mind while building the bridge ===

- Do not grief the bridge. (duh)<br />

- Try your best to not break parts of the bridge to get back up to where you were. (This is so we don't set off griefing alarms and make staff's job a nightmare)<br />

- Ensure the pillar you have built was made correctly before you begin building another.<br />

- Sometimes we may run into towns or other structures that block the bridge's path. When this happens we will need to stop and plan out what we will do next in order to get past them. This means construction may halt from time to time. Check back in the corresponding forum post in the Discord server to see if there are any current halts to the project.<br />
