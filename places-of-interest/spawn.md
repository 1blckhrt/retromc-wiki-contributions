Spawn is the area where players start their RetroMC experience. Several buildings are here to help players out.

=== Intro Warp ===

When a player first joins the server, they will be greeted with signs telling them to register a password using <code>/register (password)</code>.

The player then walks through the area displaying all the rules and information about the server.
Players, be sure to read '''all of the rules''', and then walking up the staircase, once again reminded to make sure to read '''all of the rules'''.

Players can run <code>/warp intro</code> to teleport to this area.

=== Spawn ===

The Spawn area contains a couple buildings, some of which have purposes, others empty. Players who do not use Beta Evolutions will spawn here to enter a password, and will then be teleported to the previous location they were at.

Players can run <code>/spawn</code> to teleport to this area.

=== Server Shop ===

This building allows players to buy and sell items using money. Items range from basic materials such as wood planks and cobblestone, to sponges, wool, and diamonds. Usually better prices can be found elsewhere in Spawn Town, most notably at the Moon and Mall warps.

Players can run <code>/warp shop</code> to teleport to this area.

=== Maccas ===

A Nether portal with some rules about the Nether beside it. Usually there is lava around it, but it's winter!

=== Holiday Shop ===

This building allows players to buy items specific to a holiday, usually Christmas and Halloween. It's locked in-between holidays, so no peeking!
